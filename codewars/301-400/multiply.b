 Multiply
 The program below should receive exactly
 two bytes of input, multiply them together
 and output the resulting byte as an ASCII
 character

 Example:
 Input - byte(3), byte(5)
 Output - byte(15)

 The program isn't working.  Try to figure out why.
 (Don't worry about cell overflow - this will not be tested)
